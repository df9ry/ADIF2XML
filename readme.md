Release 0.0.1 as of 2021-04-18, DF9RY - Tania (Tania@DF9RY.de)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is in development. Its purpose is the export of ADIF files
to XML, from where it can be transformed with standard XML tools and
then either direct or by using a XML2??? tool into another format.
Most wanted is the generation of EDI files, that can not be generated
yet by any free utility, so far I know.

Currently the QSO lines for EDI files are generated directly, but this
will be removed as soon as XML export is implemented.

XML transformation files can then tailored to any logbook program. For
this program is a pure commandline tool and written with the greates
portability for each and ever platform, it should be no problem to
incorporate it into any program if the author of this program like to
do so.

I understand the wish to earn money with selling of closed source
logbook programs, but this is not what is my understanding of ham
spirit. So, every bit of code I write for the hamradio community
shall, and will, be GPLed.

If you welcome this approach I will be glad to hear from you.

CU, 73, de Tania, DF9RY
